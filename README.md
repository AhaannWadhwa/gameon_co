Project skeleton created by assistant. This repository uses Next.js (App Router), Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

To finish setup locally:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill values.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`.

Notes:
- This is a starter skeleton with placeholder files and routes.
- Add real implementations for API routes, pages, and components.
